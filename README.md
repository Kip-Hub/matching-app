Matching-app is an app built as a project for Blok Tech at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam.
The app is meant to help you find capable teammates for the games you play, rather than having to deal with randoms. The feature I've worked on for Blok Tech is filtering the data that the user searched for, and returning a user profile that matches the criteria.
